        <h2>Description:</h2>

            <p>Kartoffelwurst (meaning Potato sausage) is made from the meat and bacon of either pork or beef, to which are added potatoes, onions, and various different regional spices.</p>

            <p>The primary material of the potato sausage is 50-70% of pre-cooked, finely chopped pork or beef and from 30-50% of potatoes. To this mixture is added (the precise formula varying by region) pre-cooked cubes of fatty bacon, meat (usually salted), offal, or groats, or stewed onions. Common spices are salt, pepper, and nutmeg. After the sausage mixture has been placed into the sausage casings or cans, the sausage is heated so that the blood clotting protein and the typical red-brown color is produced. On cooling, gelatin from the rind is added, which solidifies the sausage, and makes it cut resistant.</p>
            
            <p>The potato sausage is usually eaten fried. Since gelatin and fat liquefy when heated, hot potato sausage often has a mushy consistency.</p>

        <h2>Origins and History:</h2>
            
            <p>Regional variations of sausage are found particularly in the southwest of Germany, that is, in Hesse, Lower Franconia, northern Baden, Rhineland-Palatinate, and the Saarland[1]. It is also found in the canton of Graubünden in Switzerland[2].</p>
