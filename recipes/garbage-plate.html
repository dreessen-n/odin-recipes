        <h2>Description:</h2>

            <p>A Garbage Plate, according to a 2010 archive of the restaurant's official website, starts "with a base of any combination of home fries, macaroni salad, baked beans, or french fries topped by your choice of meats and dressed to your liking with spicy mustard, chopped onions, and our signature Nick Tahou's hot sauce. Each plate comes with two thick slices of fresh Italian bread and butter."[1]</p>

            <p>Another site wrote that Tahou "concocted his original combo plate with two hamburger patties and a choice of two sides â€” usually some combination of home fries, macaroni salad, and beans. The contents are often laced heavily with ketchup and hot sauce, and mixed together before eating. Rolls or white bread are served on the side."[2] Health.com named the Garbage Plate the fattiest food in the state of New York.[2]</p>

        <h2>Origins and History:</h2>
